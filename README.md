1. [20 points] We define a new model of computation, Two-Stack Push Down Automata (2SPDA)as
machine that is exactly like a PDA, except that is has two stacks (at any point in time the machine
read-write head is pointed to the top of one of these stacks), and for every state and stack letter
there is an  transition that takes the head from its current stack to the other stack. A 2SPDA,
M = (Q, Î£, Î“, q0, Z0, Î´, F) accepts a word, w, if there is a path of machine transitions that starts with
w on the machine input tape, the machine in state q0 both stacks having Z0, and reaches an accepting
state when it reaches the end of w. Prove 2SPDAâ€™s have the same computing power as Turing machines.
Namely, a language can be computed by some 2SPDA if and only if it can be computed by some Turing
machine. More concretely, given any Turing machine, T, construct a 2SODA that accepts the same
language that T does, and given any 2SPDA, M = (Q, Î£, Î“, q0, Z0, Î´, F), describe in detail a Turing
machine that accepts the language L(M).
2. Consider the following languages:
â€¢ L1 = {a
nb
k
:
n
k
is an integer },
â€¢ L2 = {a
nb
k
: n is an even number and k is a prime number, or, n is an odd number and k is not
a prime number }.
For each of these languages,
(a) [2 Ã— 10 points] Describe a Turing machine M that decides it. Namely, a machine M that halts
on every input and L(M) = L.
(b) [2 Ã— 5 points] Prove that L is not a regular language.
(c) [2 Ã— 10 points] Find out whether L a CFL and prove your claim.
3. [Bonus 10 points]Prove that each of the following languages, L, is decidable. That is, that there
exist a Turing machine M that halts on every input, such that L(M) = L. LÏ€ = {a
n : in the decimal
expansion of Ï€ there is a run of at least n consecutive 7â€™s }.
4. [2 Ã— 15 points] Prove that each of the following problems is not decidable:
(a) Input: A code P for a program. Decision: Does P halt on infinitely many inputs?
(b) Input: Codes for two programs P1, P2. Decision: Do these two programs compute functions with
the same domain? (Namely, is it the case that for every input I, P1 halts of I if and only if P2
halts on I?).
